###SOCIAL TECH INITIATOR###

##Steps to Run##
1. For your reference : My flutter version while developing this project : Flutter 3.27.1 | Dart 3.6.0
2. run ```flutter pub get``` to get the dependencies
3. Run the flutter app on android.

##Notes##
1. Used Cubit in Auth as it doesn't require event based approach for it being very simple.
2. Used BloC pattern with proper event, state and bloc for the Posts Screen.
3. Used both BloC and Cubit so that I can present the use case of both of them.
4. Used SharedPrefs to manage Login State.
5. Used named routes as I prefer that.
6. I have tried to make the code and functionalities modular/reusable components.
7. Followed lower_case_with_underscore for file and folder names and have used CamelCase for class names.
8. Used relative imports in the project as that is a better pattern.
9. Also implemented Firebase Cloud Functions to print new post information.
10. I have used Firebase for authentication and Cloud Firestore for storing users and posts data.
